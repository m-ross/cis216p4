This program, after receiving a file name from the user, will present a menu that lets the user choose whether to add to the list, find a person in the list, display the list, and quit. If the user enters inappropriate or no input, they will be asked again. Otherwise, if they close a prompt, the program will escape from where it was, possibly exiting the program. I tried to make the class usage slightly more logical based on your advice, and I removed objects.
